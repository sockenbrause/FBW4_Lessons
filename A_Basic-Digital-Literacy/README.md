- Use the linux bash terminal to navigate, create, view and manipulate files and folders in the operating system.

- Visualize how the internet works and identify various components of a URL

- Use tools such as git and GitHub to implement a versioning history and collaborate on their projects

- Author documents using a basic markup language such as markdown
