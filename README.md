# Web Development

  

**An 11 month track to train entry-level web developers**

  

The following pages describe the 11 month web development curriculum. Each folder above represents a **Top Level Module (TLM)** of the curriculum. Each **_TLM_** Contains in turn a set of folder to represent **Sub Modules (SM)**, which contains a set of learning objectives, topics that have been taught, and exercises practiced in FbW4 class.

## Non Linear TLM

To fully understand Our curriculum, we can represent it as a dependency graph, where each module is connected to it's **_prerequisites_**. Viewing the curriculum this way, gives us the ability on how to learn it in a correct path we choose, **as long as the prerequisites are met**.

  

The following graph represents potential tracks in which we can take together in order to get them from Basic Literacy to the final project.
